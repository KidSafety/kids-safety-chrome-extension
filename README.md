`KidGuard Chrome Extension`

Problem Addressed:
This extension serves as a comprehensive solution for parents and schools to monitor online activities, tracking traffic, and preventing access to harmful websites.

Use Case:
When the extension detects a harmful website, the offending tab is automatically closed. In its place, a new tab opens, informing the user about the nature of the website and advising them to safely close the tab and continue browsing.

Core Features:
- Default blocking of a predefined set of harmful websites.
- Parental control to Add/Remove/Whitelist websites.
- Tracking and monitoring the web history of children.

Security Measures:
- Exclusive access for parents via a passcode-protected dashboard.
- Alerts for parents if the child attempts to remove/turn off the extension or repeatedly accesses the same harmful website.

User Authentication:
- Google login required for both parents and children to use the extension.
- During the first login, users choose whether the account is designated as a parent or child.
